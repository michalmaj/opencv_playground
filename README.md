# OpenCV Playground in Modern C++

A collection of small computer vision projects and demos written in modern C++ (C++23) using OpenCV 4.8.1.  
Built with [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and managed with [Conan 2.0](https://docs.conan.io/2/).

This repository is a personal playground for experimenting with OpenCV and related tools.  
Each subdirectory contains a self-contained demo with its own `main.cpp`.

- [CMake ‚â• 3.20](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [Conan 2.0+](https://docs.conan.io/2/)
